Design choices: 

I chose red as the main colour for this site as the pokedex in the pokemon universe is red. After that, I made the boxes for each different pokemon resemble the shape of the screen on the real pokedex to keep a sense of authenticity. The rest of the design elements are meant to be sleek and simple, as the site is just meant to be informative, so the pokemon themselves (and their info) should be the main point of interest. Using pop ups is a great wqay to easily display information and allow the user to jump between pokemon.
