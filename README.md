Steps:

First I set up my HTML and CSS files. I did create a javscript file but did not yet utilise it in this assignment. The firts thing I worked on was a basic HTML layout including the header, main page, and footer. All necessary elements were added in, and then I began basic CSS trying to match the mockup. I did decide on minor changes to the layout, but it does keep the overall essence of the mockup. I used an online CSS shape creator (https://www.cssportal.com/css-clip-path-generator/) to help with the unique shape of the pokedex boxes. Adjusting the percentages on the shapes to fit with the different screen sizes did not ake too long. I did have some trouble with flexbox while resizing the screen, however with some trial and error, I think it managed to look alright. I knew that I wanted the boxes themselves to respond to cursor hovering / focusing. Once most of the difficult parts was making sure the padding and margin didn't interfere with screen sizing changes. I usually do not encounter this problem, however, this time I had to spend an extra half hour fixing it. I didn't end up using any bootstrap for this project.

I wanted to make the boxes appear using a JS loop, but I had a bit too much trouble with it. I decided I would place the boxes in HTML and go back next week to have them appear using JS arrays and loops.
